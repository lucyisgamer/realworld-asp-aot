# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [ASP.NET] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This is a work-in-progress implementation of the RealWorld API, made using ASP.NET Minimal APIs, Npgsql, and designed to support NativeAOT when building.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

> TODO - come up with a viable architecture for this

# Getting started

> Build and run it like any other C# project, NuGet is cool like that...
